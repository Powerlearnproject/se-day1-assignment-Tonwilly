Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  software engineering is the design, development deployment and maintenance of application and software systems 
  Software engineering is the backbone of technology industry by enabling development of software systems that each aspect of technology industry, communication, modern life, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1. development of programming languages - establishment of languages to be used to write programs that carry out tasks on the computer
  2. establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s - the introduction of software engineering the key for computer engineering growth
  3. advent of structured programming in 1970s - the introduction of writing code in a procedural manner
  4. rise of agile methodologies in 2000s - the increase of incremental approaches in software development

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Requirements' specification: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
   Design: Creating designs of the software architecture and user interface.
   Coding: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
   Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and   functional requirements.
  Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  waterfall methodology is a systematic approach in software development that requires predefined and predicted requirements for efficient implementation.
  example. appropriate where all requirements are known and updates are predicted
  agile methodology is methodology that focuses on incremental development by iteration for flexibility and adaptability.
  example. where user requirements and environment conditions keep changing


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  Software developers - writes code for building software and implements software
  Qualty assurance eng. ensures software standard and tests software
  Project manager - oversees planning, building and execution of software projectss


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  IDEs - software that give developers tools for writing code, testing and debugging
  VS code, pycharm
  VCs - software for tracking changes on code and enhancing coordination among team members
  Git



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  tight deadlines
  frequent requirements specification changes
  technical debt

solution
  effective communication
  regular reassessment on project goals and timelines


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  unit testing is testing individual components of software
  integration testing is testing how different components work together
  system testing is the testing the system holistically
  acceptance testing is testing how the software meets the user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  is the crafting of questions to get the best response from AI models.
  it helps in getting the most correct, clear and concise answer from AI  models


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Tell me about manchester united
  Tell me achievements and current stature of manchester united, and some of the best players and coaches it has had
  
  It includes the necessary details that I would want to here from the AI model, not the generalised information which may be little useful
